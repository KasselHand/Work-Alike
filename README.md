     Kassel Hand Project Work-Alike Model README

     This model of the Kassel Hand has edited interior components that deviate from 
     the form of the original artifact so they can function closer to the original 
     metal material of the artifact. It's a durable version that can be used to do 
     activities. Below is a readme file containing General Print settings, a file 
     naming convention for our repository, and helpful links to the assembly videos 
     on YouTube. Happy printing!

    1.) Print Settings for Work-Alike
    
    a) link to GCode
    
    b) General Print Settings
        I.) We used an Anycubic Kobra 3 with the Anycubic Slicer.
       II.) 2 Vertical Shells, 4 Horizontal Shells with a minimum thickness of 0.6mm.
      III.) 15% infill density, grid pattern
       IV.) 0.16mm layer height
        V.) Organic supports with a 0.28mm Z contact distance and 2.5mm spacing
       VI.) Top and bottom interface layers should be 3 layers thick.
      VII.) Print the paddle (M-11) oriented where the flat of the paddle is normal 
            to the plate and the rod is parallel. While this may seem like the 
            worst orientation to print, the goal is to have the layer lines run 
            along the rod and for the presence of unbroken layers circumnavigating 
            the entire rod and paddle. This is for maximum strength.
              1.) If you are using this as a display model, then you can print it 
                  with the thin rod on the plate with paddle pointed up, like a     
                  letter "L" rotated backwards 90 degrees.
     VIII.) 2mm brim with a 0.25mm brim separation gap
       IX.) Print the gauntlet bottom, "S-01," vertically, where the region the 
            fingers would be is pointed up and the wrist of the gauntlet is 
            touching the plate. The top of the gauntlet, "S-02," should be 
            horizontal, with one side wall touching the plate. This orientation is for the best 
            resulting strength where the highest loading occurs.
        X.) Print the rest of the mechanism parts, those with files names starting 
            with "M-##" with their flattest end on the plate. This includes all 
            fingers: M-07, M-08, M-09, and M-10.
       XI.) M-13 and M-14, the axles, can be printed horizontally. The rod rests 
            length-wise along the plate.
      XII.) M-15 is an exception to Part viii of the print settings--for best 
            results, we have found printing with the loop parallel to the plate is 
            best.
     XIII.) M-16 should be printed with the loop flat on the plate as you would 
            expect a ring to sit atop a table.

    2.) File Naming Convention: "L-##-[Name of Part]-#X"

     a) For the first part of the file name, "L" is a Letter, "M" represents 
     Mechanism, or "S" for Shell.
        i.) Shell was printed out of gray and is a structural part.
       ii.) Mechanism is any movable part that is integral to the actuation.
     b) The following section is a twi-digit number used to identify the part.
     c) The "Name of Part" is the colloquial term for the part in question--it's 
     easier to identify if you need a new ring finger than a replacement part 
     numbered "M-03."
     d) #X is how many copies are needed.
